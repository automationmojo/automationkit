Code Optimization
=================

The desired characteristics of test code is different than that of production code.  Test code is often used to debug or step through scenarios and workflows in order to capture information about what is going on in the code that is the target of the tests.  Because test code is used so often in the debugger to perform investigations of product bugs and test issues, test code should only be optimized where there is sufficient data to show that a specific are of code is having a big negative impact on the performance of the test runs.

The reality of distributed automation frameworks is that they spend alot of time in interop APIs looping on retry attempts with delays intentionally inserted between retries.  Code that is intentionally being delayed should **NOT** be the target of code optimizations.  The following is a list of optimization techniques that are discouraged in the test code so the test code can exhibit more of the desired characteristics list above.

* One Liners or Excessive Brevity
* Nested Inlining Function Calls
* Compound return statements

I cannot stress enough that if poor test coding styles are used too much in a large code base and if the practice goes on for too long.  The code will be difficult to work in and the productivity of the consumers of the test code will be greatly impacted.

One Liners and Brevity Shortcuts
--------------------------------

One liners and code written with the intent of being brief are not allowed and or discourage in the automation code.  This is because ensuring the automation code can be easily run and stepped through in the debugger is a primary requirment.  Simple list comprehensions that get assigned to a local variable are ok such as:

```python
    dev_list = [ dev for dev in device_list ]
```

These are acceptable because you can easily see the result of the list comprehension in the debugger after the comprehension has run.  However, if the list comprehension becomes more complexed with if statements calling functions, then you should break out the list creation into mutliple lines like so:

```python
    dev_list = []
    for dev in device_list
        if dev.deviceType == 'network/upnp':
            dev_list.append(dev)
```

This is most likely a little less performant. Squeezing every last bit of performance out of the code is **NOT** a priority of creating test code that is easy to consume, maintainable and easy to debug.

Nested Inlining Function Calls
------------------------------

An important aspect of code that is friendly to debug is that it spreads out statements across multiple lines of code.  By spreading out code statement such as function calls or index accesses across mutliple lines, we attach metadata in the form of a line number to the statements which enables the debugger to work more efficiently with the statements.

The following code is not debugger friendly or efficient because the statements do not have unique line numbers associated with them in the python byte code.

```python
    some_function(param_function_a(), param_function_b(), param_function_c())
```

Another thing to keep in mind is that indexers in python are actually function calls so statements like the ones below are also undesired in test code.

```python
    some_function(data[0], data[1], data[2])
```

A better way to get data items from a squence or list would be to expand the sequence to variables We like so:

```python
    a, b, c = data
    some_function(a, b, c)
```

Compound Return Statements
--------------------------

```python
def some_function():
    return inner_function_call(inner_a(), inner_b(), inner_c(), inner_d())
```

For more details about how returns should be written, see the [Return Statements](## Return Statements) section.

Multiline Error Message Formation
=================================

An important part of creating greate automation frameworks and tools is the sharing of expert knowledge between consumers of the automation framework code base.  A great way to implement knowledge sharing is to write code so that it provides detailed contextual information when errors occur.  This is important because the last person working or dealing with an issue in the error handling code is working on the problem and has the best knowledge about the context when the error occurs and should share that knowledge with others.

As part of providing well formed and detailed error reporting, we want to be able to see and debug the code that is creating the error messages.  When creating multi-line error messages, the following method is preferred.

* Create a list to hold the error message lines
* Iterate any data collections or collect data and append lines to the list
* Create section headers for individual data sections
* Join the list of error message lines together using os.linesep.join() and assign the message to a variable so it can be seen in the debugger
* pass the error message variable to the exception

The code below provides an example of the building of a detailed error message that is easy to debug.

```python

    err_msg_lines = [
        "Failed to find expected UPNP devices after a timeout of {} seconds.".format(response_timeout)
    ]
    err_msg_lines.append("EXPECTED: ({})".format( len(expected_devices) ))
    for dkey in expected_devices:
        err_msg_lines.append("    {}:".format(dkey))
    err_msg_lines.append("")

    err_msg_lines.append("MATCHING: ({})".format( len(scan_context.matching_devices) ))
    for dkey in scan_context.matching_devices:
        err_msg_lines.append("    {}:".format(dkey))
    err_msg_lines.append("")

    err_msg_lines.append("FOUND: ({})".format( len(scan_context.found_devices) ))
    for dkey in scan_context.found_devices:
        err_msg_lines.append("    {}:".format(dkey))
    err_msg_lines.append("")

    err_msg_lines.append("MISSING: ({})".format( len(missing) ))
    for dkey in missing:
        err_msg_lines.append("    {}:".format(dkey))
    err_msg_lines.append("")

    err_msg = os.linesep.join(err_msg_lines)
    raise AKitTimeoutError(err_msg) from None

```

Return Statements
=================

All functions or methods that are not generators should have a `return` statement.  The return statements are important for three reasons:

* It prevents the formation of appended functionality during a bad code merge
* It provides line number data for the debugger
* It provides a way to check results, in context, before a return
* It make code easier to read

Below is a detailed description of each of these issues.

Formation of Appended Functionality
-----------------------------------

One of the common tasks that is performed frequently by software developer is the refactoring or merging of code.  During the process of refactoring or merging code, function declarations might be missed or incorrectly deleted.  When this happens, new functionality can end up being inadvertantly appended to the previous function in the code.  Take the following two functions as a simplified example.

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")

def say_world():
    print("World")
```

If returns are not present at the end of the functions above, during a refactor or code merge it is possible for lines of code to be removed, like if the `say_world` function declaration was deleted like so:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")

    print("World")
```

Now, without warning from python, the functionality of the `say_world` function has been appended to the `say_hello` function and thus changes the functionality of the `say_hello` function without warning.

Now lets look at what would happen if the same thing took place when return statements are utilized as in the code below.

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    return

def say_world():
    print("World")
    return
```

In the code above, we clearly mark the end of our functions so python has a better chance of doing the correct thing when code is modified incorrectly.  If the function declaration for `say_world` is removed like so.

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    return

    print("World")
    return
```

In the case above, python will not execute the stagling code and will not append its functionality to the `say_hello` method.  Also, the python linter can show the remaining code body for `say_world` as dead code or unreachable code and complain when it tries to lint the code in the file.

Line Number for Debugging
-------------------------
A very important aspect of test code is debuggability.  In order to be able to inspect the results of a function before it returns, you need a line of code to hang a breakpoint on. By
stopping the debugger on the return statement, you can see the values of the inputs to the
function and values of any intermediate byproducts or local variables in the context of the
function.

```python
import dis

def function_with_return(a: int, b: int):
    if a + b == 99:
        print ("Hello '99'")
    return

def function_without_return(a: int, b: int):
    if a + b == 99:
        print ("Hello '99'")

print("==== FUNCTION WITH RETURN ====")
fwr_assem = dis.dis(function_with_return)
print(fwr_assem)
print("")


print("==== FUNCTION WITHOUT RETURN ====")
fwor_assem = dis.dis(function_without_return)
print(fwor_assem)
print("")
```

```bash
==== FUNCTION WITH RETURN ====
  4           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              2 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 LOAD_CONST               1 (99)
              8 COMPARE_OP               2 (==)
             10 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       20

  5          12 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
             14 LOAD_CONST               2 ("Hello '99'")
             16 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             18 POP_TOP

  6     >>   20 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)  # Has a Distict Line Number (6)
             22 RETURN_VALUE
None
```

Distinct lines of code, which have an associated line number, are very important for enabling a
great debugging experience.  Without a distinct line of code or line number, there is no place
to hang a breakpoint on a piece of code that is associated with the bytecode of a program.

```bash
==== FUNCTION WITHOUT RETURN ====
  9           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              2 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 LOAD_CONST               1 (99)
              8 COMPARE_OP               2 (==)
             10 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       20

 10          12 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
             14 LOAD_CONST               2 ("Hello '99'")
             16 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             18 POP_TOP
        >>   20 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)  # Has NO Line Number
             22 RETURN_VALUE
None
```


In Context Return Verification
------------------------------

One of the most important aspects of writing debuggable code, is to write code in such a way that you can see the values of the local variables that contributed to the creation of the value being returned.  The following is an example function that demonstrates the concept of writing functions so the context of the return value can be examined.

```python
def example_function(a: int, b: int) -> int:

    multiplier = random.randint(0, 10)

    rtnval: int = (a + b) * multiplier
    
    return rtnval
```

From looking at the simple example above, you can see that in order to debug the function and
make sure it is returning the correct answer, it is useful to be able to see the `multiplier`
parameter that is generated locally and is being used to effect the output.  Providing a simple
independant return allows us to see the context that is generating the output value.  Another
example below shows how a function like this might be written that will not provide the same
ability to debug the function.

```python
def example_function(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return (a + b) * random.randint(0, 10)
```

This function is sometimes valued by some developers for its brevity, but for testing purposes this coding style results in reduced quality code. The reason the code is reduced quality is because you cannot see the context of the return value being generated.  If you put a breakpoint
on the `return` statement, you don't see the resulting value until you step out into the calling function context. When you step out of the function to its calling function to see the return value, the local variables of the `example_function` and the context that generated the return 
value is no longer available. Upon the return of the function, the stack was popped and the 
context went away.

Because of the importance of examining the context that generates a returned value, it is always prefered to create a local variable in order to effect a simple return like so:

```python
def example_function(a: int, b: int, c: int):
    rtnval = (a + b) * c
    return rtnval
```

Vise a complexed return statement such as

```python
def example_function(a: int, b: int, c: int):
    return (a + b) * c
```

Code Legibility
---------------

Finally, `return` statements are important to improve the legibility of code. Because python code uses indentation to determine scope, the repeated indentation of successive code blocks can present issues with the readability of code. This can particularly be a problem with longer functions.  The example code below demonstates the improvement of ligibility that a return statement can offer.

```python
def example_function(a: Optional[int], b: Optional[int], c: Optional[int], d: Optional[int]):
    val = None

    if a is not None:
        print (a)
        if b is not None:
            print (a + b)
            if c is not None:
                print ((a + b) * c)
                if d is not None:
                    print ((a + b) * c) + d
    return
```

For the code above, it is clear where the end of the function resides as it has a return.  This can be particularly important if this was a longer function.

For the function below, it might be a little more confusing where a function ends in a larger block of code.

```python
def example_function(a: Optional[int], b: Optional[int], c: Optional[int], d: Optional[int]):
    rtnval = None

    if a is not None:
        print (a)
        if b is not None:
            print (a + b)
            if c is not None:
                print ((a + b) * c)
                if d is not None:
                    print ((a + b) * c) + d
```

For consistency and to help resolve all of these issues, I prefer to use returns on all of my functions and methods.  Any function or method that is not a generator, since generators don't have returns.
