Getting Started
***************

The *AutomationKit* is distributed as a PyPi package.  So you can utilize it
to create your own distributed automation projects.  If you like.

However, keep in mind it can take a significant amount time and effort to learn
how to setup a really effective enterprise class automation project that scale
to meet the needs of a large organization.  Creating such a project takes alot
of trial and error and most likely lots of refactoring as you learn more about
the unexpected challenges the complexed automation projects can throw at you.

Luckily, I have already learned alot of those lessons and that is one of the
reasons I set out to write the *AutomationKit* framework.

To make it easy to get started, I created a **Template** project that makes it
super easy to get started using the **AutomationKit** in a real world automation
project repository that is layed out or organized well in order to make it scale
well and avoid alot of pitfalls that show up a couple years into the effort when
you really don't need them to.

The template project and its associated documentation is located here.

`Automation Kit Quick Start <https://github.com/automationmojo/akit-quickstart>`_

To use the repository, you will create your own copy of the repository from the
template, you can follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Create your repository
==============================
Because the **Automation Kit Quick Start** repository is setup as a template repository, when
you view it in GitHub, you will see a **Use this Template** button.

After clicking the **Use this Template** button, you should see the form popup that allows
you to enter the name and restrictions of the new repository.  Enter the information in the
form and click the **Create repository from template** button.

Step 2: Branch the repository
=============================
Once you have create a new repository for your project or organization.  You need to change
some things in the repository to brand it for your organziation.  The following sections
describes the things that will need to be change in order to brand the repository for your
organization.

In order to brand the repository for your organization, follow the instructions in the
branding instructions provided by the **Automation QuickStart Project**.  The instructions
are found in the `Automation Quick Start Documention <https://automationmojo.github.io/akit-quickstart/usermanual/00-repository-branding.html>`_
